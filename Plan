This app will provide ease of access to those in need in search of food.

Home Screen:
The main page the app will open up with will be a page to enter your location into. Once the location is entered, it will bring you to the map page where the food areas closest to you will be displayed.
There will be a toggle menu on the left side with options to either go to the main page, see an actual list of the food locations page, and an about the app page.

Main Page:
A text box will be at the top center, asking for your location.
Users will enter their desired location into the input box in the center of the screen.
After entering your location and hitting enter, the user will be brought to a map centered on their location, with the food locations pinged on the map around them.
Clicking on these locations will bring you to that specific events details page which will include a description of the event, what date and time the event is available, and the event address.

Listing Page:
The listing page will be a vertical list of the different events taking place.
If the user has already entered their location, the listings will be sorted by which is closest to their location.
If the user hasn't entered their location, the listings will be sorted alphabetically.
Clicking on a listing will bring you to that events details page.

About Page:
A simple page where I'll describe why I made this app and how it works.
